# Project 3: Adding Functionality to Our System

## Overview
In this project, we have two executables: `oss.c` and `worker.c`. The `oss` executable will launch workers, and `oss` will maintain a system clock. The goal is to demonstrate the creation and management of processes in a UNIX-like environment, handling inter-process communication, and ensuring process synchronization using message queues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, Cygwin)
- GCC compiler installed

- Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/masfm8/sarker.3

- Navigate to the project directory:
- cd sarker.3
Compile the programs using 'make'. To ensure the test script is executable: I used 'chmod +x test.sh
' Execute the test script to validate functionality:

Testing
The 'test.sh' script is designed to execute the program with various parameters to ensure all aspects of the program are functioning as expected.
